Create custom post type that is then available as a WYSIWYG Editor option for links to be opened in modal window.

== Description ==

Sometimes content doesn't need it's own separate page but it's enough that you don't want to jam it all into one page.  Modals are a great way to handle situations just like that.  This creates a new post type and menu option in the main menu in the admin site.  Add posts here just like you would in Posts or Pages.  Then go into the Post or Page (or other post type you may have) and there is a new option in the editor toolbar.  This allows you to create a link that will open one of those Modal post types into a modal window rather than sending the user to a separate page.

== Installation ==

Installation of the Post Access Controller is pretty standard.

1. Download the zip archive of the plugin
2. Extract the archive
3. Upload that archive to the /wp-content/plugins/simple-modal/ folder
4. Go to the Plugins menu in the admin of your WP site
5. Click Activate in the Simple Modal line
6. Go to the Settings -> Simple Modal page to indicate the height and width of the four built-in sizes supported out of the box.
7. Done! You're ready to start creating modal posts and linking to them from wherever you'd like!
